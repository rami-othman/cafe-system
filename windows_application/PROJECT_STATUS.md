# Project Status

## Project Name

Cafe System 618

## Current Goal

Establish the general project foundation for a Flutter Windows desktop cafe and
restaurant management system.

## Current Phase

Phase 1 — Project Foundation

## Completed Work

- Created the initial Flutter project scaffold.
- Added foundation dependencies for routing, state management, dependency
  injection, value equality, and currency formatting.
- Created the feature-based folder structure.
- Added the app entry point, router, desktop shell placeholder, core utilities,
  shared widgets, and POS placeholder screen.
- Added general documentation/control files for future Codex work.
- Implemented shared theme/design system foundation.
- Implemented desktop app shell with sidebar, topbar, main content slot, and
  right panel slot.
- Implemented static POS screen UI with product area and cart panel.
- Fixed responsive/adaptive layout behavior for POS shell and static POS UI.
- Implemented POS Cubit with fake data interactions, cart updates, order type
  selection, and local totals calculation.

## In Progress

- None. Ready for POS Cubit fake-data interaction work.

## Next Step

Implement product customization/modifiers dialog for configurable POS items.

## Architecture Decisions

- Flutter is used for the Windows desktop app.
- The app is desktop-first, with possible future tablet support.
- The project uses feature-based architecture.
- Each feature uses an MVC-style internal structure.
- Cubit is used as the controller/state-management layer.
- Theme values should be centralized.
- Feature-specific logic should stay inside its feature.
- Shared reusable UI should go inside `shared`.

## Important Constraints

- Do not create feature-specific documentation until requested.
- Do not create `POS_FLOW.md` yet.
- Do not implement backend API integration yet.
- Do not add database or local storage yet.
- Keep changes focused and avoid unrelated refactors.
- Avoid over-engineering.

## Open Questions

- Detailed component states are not fully defined yet.
- The expected Manrope variable font file still needs to be added if absent.
- Backend integration approach is not defined yet.
- Tablet support requirements are not defined yet.
